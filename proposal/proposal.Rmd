## 1. Introduction

We have decided that for our project, it would be interesting to try and find what makes a song popular in its genre. For this, we will use spotify_songs which gets its data from the spotifyr package which in turn gets its data from spotify.

## 2. Data



## 3. Data analysis plan

Since the aim of the project is to examine what aspects make a song popular the response variable will always be the popularity of a song (track_popularity). Each genre of music will be studied separately, using all the numeric variables as well as the artist of each song. The comparison groups are the genres of music.
